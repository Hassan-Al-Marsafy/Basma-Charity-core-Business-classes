# Charity-website-Basmah-
This is a web-development software project for an existing organization "Basmah Charity Organization" The software is designed to be user-friendly that meets the unique needs of the charity. The goal is to establish an online presence, enable secure donations, share information about initiatives, and provides volanteering option.

The envisioned website revolves around a comprehensive educational and ethical development program for children. This initiative aims to tackle challenges like corruption and inadequate education, nurturing a new generation with a strong moral compass and a sense of responsibility towards their community.

The website will allow users to apply for different program paths, schedule interviews, and make donations for their chosen paths. While the system is similar in concept to other charitable organizations, such as Resala, it's specifically tailored to Basmah's requirements, making it more focused and efficient.
